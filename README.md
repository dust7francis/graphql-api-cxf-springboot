# graphql-api-cxf-springboot
A GraphQL API gateway built with serverless and microservice patterns with REST API based on CXF/Spring-boot.

It is to cater for exposing customer self-service using a GraphQL API gateway in serverless patterns for clients accessing from web applications or mobile applications.

The design goals are:

  * Build Low Latency API to serve complex, high dimensional and big datasets'

  * Using a single query, return a nested response from multiple data sources

  * Build an api gateway to securely aggregate data with high performance.

  * Build with severless and microservices patterns
